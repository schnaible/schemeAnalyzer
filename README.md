 Description: This project reads in a .ss file (scheme code) and outputs a    
 .cpp file (C++ code) that performs exactly the same.                         
 Most features appear to be working such as outputting with cout, and most    
 arithmetic and object creation. However more complex arithmetic like         
 `(* 2 (+ 1 3) (/ 4 2) )` may not work properly. Setting __RetVal is also not 
 100% functional. We are not printing it in some places, and printing it in   
 areas that we do not need it.
